					Wellness is the complete integration of body, mind, and spirit – the realization that everything we do, think, feel, and believe has an effect on our state of
					well-being. <br />~Greg Anderson
				</p>

				<p>
					If you are a night person who is fond of binge-watching everyday, it surely becomes highly exhausting for you to wake up early for work. Sleeping for less than
					6 hours can make you feel bizarre and irritated.
				</p>

				<p>A cup of tea/coffee ought to cheer up your mood for some time but it is not enough. <strong>Sleep deprivation</strong> leads to a loss of concentration.</p>

				<p>So, what is it that will help you solve this?</p>

				<p>Working on your sleep schedule, of course, that’s the first. A night of good and sound sleep is your utmost need.</p>

				<p>However, it is not a piece of cake. Pulling an all-nighter is very refreshing for many, these days.</p>

				<p>In consideration of that, you have to put the next best alternative to use- <strong>Meditation.</strong></p>

				<p>
					<strong>Yoga and meditation</strong> in the early morning have always proved to be constructive. It strengthens focus, improves self-awareness and reduces
					stress levels.
				</p>

				<p>This is what the situation demands.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Wake up one hour prior to your working hour</li>
					<li>Freshen up</li>
					<li>Have some tea/coffee</li>
					<li>Lay a mat on the floor</li>
					<li>Sit on it and fold your legs</li>
					<li>Keep your backbone straight</li>
					<li>Close your eyes</li>
					<li>Meditate for 5-10 minutes</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Tada! It's done. Now you can kickstart your day off with a clear mind.</p>

				<p>
					Likewise, meditation is a wonderful thing to end your day with. After a long day of work, both your body and mind are tired. You crave for some relief at the
					moment.
				</p>

				<p>Excessive work often leads your mind to close down. It even makes you anxious.</p>

				<p>In that case, the only thing you need to shut down, is your working device. Once it is past your work hour, you should put your system away immediately.</p>

				<p>The next step is to reduce your distress caused during work. Meditation can also assist you with this.</p>

				<p>The clock strikes 6 pm- assuming that is when you get off work. And it is a time-out!</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Be clear of your work desk</li>
					<li>Drink some water</li>
					<li>Wash your face</li>
					<li>Sit on the yoga mat</li>
					<li>Meditate for 5 minutes</li>
				</ul>

				<p>And you are good to go!</p>
