				<p>
					Remote working is easily misunderstood by people, especially those who are not really used to it. Today’s generation has clarity about the entire notion of work
					from home because they have either experienced it themselves or witnessed someone else.
				</p>

				<p>On the contrary, the older generation is not that familiar with this idea. To your parents, work from home is more of a work without any strict routine.</p>

				<p>Due to which, they do not really understand the gravity of it. Therefore, it is your responsibility to make them understand how it will work.</p>

				<p>
					There might be days where you do not have much work and you would just come out of your room to feed your pet or help your mother chop vegetables for lunch.
					That should not send signals to the people in your vicinity that you are available everyday to do other household chores.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose you are attending an online meeting and your mother barges in, all of a sudden, to tell you something. Your mind is distracted, even if you don’t want
					it to be.
				</p>

				<p>Or what if you have younger siblings coming from school during your work hours? How do you work while being in a chaotic environment? You cannot, right?</p>

				<p>Ergo! You need to set some rules with them.</p>

				<p>
					Have an open conversation with your family members and explain the expectations of the work from home culture. Set clear rules for the kids telling them what
					they should do and what not.
				</p>

				<p>Once they acknowledge this, you would be set on your way. Otherwise, it can often lead to various hurdles in your professional life.</p>

				<p>Here how it goes,</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Ask your elders to join you for a small chat</li>
					<li>Tell them about how you are planning to work from home</li>
					<li>Mention your estimated work hours and how you should not be bothered during that period of time</li>
					<li>Hand the responsibility of controlling the kids, if any, to the elders</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This would definitely work!!</p>
