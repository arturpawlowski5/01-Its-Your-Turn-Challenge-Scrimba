				<p>What is the best thing about working from home? Most probably, the level of comfort.</p>

				<p>But, do you know that this comfort can come at the cost of lost productivity, focus and target goals?</p>

				<p>
					As much as home working is a convenience for many as they can coop up in their bed or couch, it becomes really difficult to resist the temptation of sleep with
					our not-so-healthy sleep routine.
				</p>

				<p>
					That way, you can either give in to your lethargy - which is extremely demotivating - or decide to come out of the enticement of your typical home setting. The
					latter is always better and more productive.
				</p>

				<p>You might sit at any place, start working on your task list, and all of a sudden, a movie or an ad plays on TV. What is your instant reaction?</p>

				<p>
					You turn around and take a glimpse, thus creating a distraction. It is likely possible to happen every now and then if you choose a random spot to work.
					<strong>Distractions</strong> will flow in from every way.
				</p>

				<p>Therefore, having a particular space all to yourself will absolutely do a great deal.</p>

				<p>When the surrounding gives you work vibes, your attention is bound to swoop in along with your efficiency. To achieve that, all you have to do is:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Choose a corner of your room with good natural lighting, if possible</li>
					<li>Set it up with a chair comfortable to sit on, for around 8 hours a day</li>
					<li>Place a desk next to it</li>
					<li>Put your system on the placed desk</li>
					<li>Keep your required materials like a diary, pens, a bottle of water & a lamp, right by the side</li>
				</ul>

				<p>A <strong>dedicated workspace</strong> will enable you to keep yourself oriented to your work by providing an office-esque environment.</p>

				<p>Because in the end, concentration is the key to effective outcomes.</p>
