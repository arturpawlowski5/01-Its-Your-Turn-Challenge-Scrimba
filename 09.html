				<h1><strong>09.</strong><br />Take a Few <strong>Breaks</strong></h1>

				<img class="img-hero" src="img/Work-from-home-tips-09.png" alt="work from home tips" />

				<p>When you are in office, it is really common to yearn for breaks for your mind to relax. But at home, the structure is different.</p>

				<p>You are more of working in a break situation, yet you are not <strong>taking breaks.</strong> This means a home is a place we go to, after work.</p>

				<p>But when you start operating from home, it becomes messy.</p>

				<p>Your work-time can get tangled with your breaks. This is why you should set precise time for breaks.</p>

				<p>Do not drain your brain muscle by constantly sitting in one place for work. The stress can get hold of you anywhere.</p>

				<p>Just move around and keep yourself active throughout the day.</p>

				<p>
					Take breaks at definite intervals, walk around, play with your pet or maybe listen to some music. It is purely scientific, your prefrontal cortex (the thinking
					part of the brain) needs breaks to avoid decision fatigue and maximize production capacity along with amplifying your creativity.
				</p>

				<p>You may also take short naps or do breathing exercises to be more mindful and efficient throughout the day.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Add a proper break-time schedule to your planner</li>
					<li>Specify how much time duration is assigned to each break</li>
					<li>When the clock strikes the specified time, stop with your work instantly</li>
				</ul>

				<p>You can launch a timer on your deviceâ€™s screen in a way that would lock you out of your computer during breaks.</p>
