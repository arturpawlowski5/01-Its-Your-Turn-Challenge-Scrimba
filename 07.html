				<h1><strong>07.</strong><br />Prepare a <strong>To-do list/Planner</strong></h1>

				<p>You are surely familiar with the term To-do list. What is it exactly?</p>

				<p>It is nothing but an index of tasks to be finished on the following day, organized in order of priority. A planner is more or less the same thing.</p>

				<p>Both are two sides of the same coin.</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Working remotely</strong> recommends you to keep track of how you spend every hour of your day. Self-tracking lets you understand when you are more
					productive and also, where you are wasting your precious time.
				</p>

				<p>
					Creating a to-do list would allow you to keep track of your progress efficiently. You can then choose to do the more critical tasks in your precise productive
					hours.
				</p>

				<p>You can design the list as per your preference. The critical task is to be treated as the highest priority and should be worked on, at the earliest.</p>

				<p>And designate the highest amount of time to the most difficult one.</p>

				<p>
					While you construct your list, think about long-term goals- finishing a big project, as well as short-term goals- the tasks which lead to that big goal. As you
					are completing one goal after another, check them off the list indicating that you are making progress.
				</p>

				<p>This keeps your focus intact, thereby improving your knowledge and makes the work seem doable. And you look forward to accomplishing the rest of the duties.</p>

				<p>
					Similarly, a planner or a calendar is an <strong>accountability tool</strong> - to keep track of meetings, deadlines and appointments. This way, you do not have
					to devote headspace to constantly remembering your office chores.
				</p>

				<p>
					All this information would be in the record of a planner. It reminds you about which task is to be delivered on which date and schedule of your meetings &
					appointments.
				</p>

				<p>
					The planner can also take your availability into account. It should include your other commitments too so that you are able to work accordingly and your
					colleagues & family members know when you are available for their work.
				</p>

				<p>Be it work or non-work activities, a to-do list and a planner are essential for positive reinforcement.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Write or type in your To-do list & a planner/calendar because remembering so much can give you a severe headache</li>
					<li>Create it systematically so that it is easily understandable</li>
					<li>Share the planner with your co-workers to notify them of the time you have blocked out on the calendar for official work</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Remote work demands you to hold yourself accountable for every minute piece of work you are assigned and prioritizing & scheduling your work can give you the
					best results.
