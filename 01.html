				<p>What is your favorite outfit when working remotely?</p>

				<p>
					Pajamas, is it? Of course, it should be, as you get to be in your comfort zone. Dressing up is something that people do not bother about while working from
					home.
				</p>

				<p>But that’s not how it should be. You must get ready for your work as you usually do.</p>

				<p>Yes, you heard that right. Get out of your sleepwear.</p>

				<p>
					Casual dress or pajamas are great, and they give you comfort and a sense of freedom. But donning sweatpants may not help you to
					<strong>stay productive</strong> if you wear it for 48 hours straight.
				</p>

				<p>It is not necessary to dress as formally as you might, for work, but a mere act of changing clothes will give you a signal to wake up and get work done.</p>

				<p>
					Our brains are programmed in a way that it takes cues from our social and personal outlook while making a decision. When you dress up for your work, you give
					the brain a reason for doing it. It’s like a real alarm that can keep you alert throughout the day.
				</p>

				<p>
					Getting dressed includes all the appearance-based tasks — taking shower, doing your hair and minimal makeup. These factors
					<strong>make you look presentable.</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Besides, working from home does not certainly mean that people cannot see you. You might be asked to show up for video meetings which are very common these
					days.
