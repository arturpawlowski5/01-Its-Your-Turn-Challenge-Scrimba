				<p>One way to <strong>increase your performance</strong> at work is to be proactive. And regular exercise can help you be that.</p>

				<p>
					Adopting the habit of doing exercise is beneficial for both your personal and professional life. You increase blood flow to the brain while you
					<strong>workout</strong>, which further helps to sharpen your mind and keep you alert.
				</p>

				<p>
					The whole concept of work from home has given rise to social isolation which has affected <strong>mental health</strong> of people to a great extent. In such a
					case, staying fit should be considered as a topmost-priority.
				</p>

				<p>
					Exercise heightens your endorphin levels which boosts your happiness, enjoyment and interest levels- all of which are important for producing good results at
					work & life.
				</p>

				<p>Maintaining a great posture is an added necessity which comes from stretching regularly.</p>

				<p>Try to take some time out and exercise, even if it is for 15 minutes. Move your muscles or go for a long walk, whatever sounds feasible for you.</p>

				<p>Begin your day with an exercise, in a non-chaotic environment. It prepares you to take on the challenges throughout the day.</p>

				<p>But making it into a habit would give you immense benefits that you would be grateful for in the future. You would start seeing the difference it makes.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Wake up early in the morning</li>
					<li>Choose a proper wide spot so that itâ€™s not congested</li>
					<li>Exercise for 15 minutes</li>
					<li>Repeat the same routine on the next day and increase the time duration</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Generally, when you work from home, you might not get the motivation to exercise daily.</p>

				<p>What you need is a push from yourself for your <strong>physical wellbeing.</strong></p>
