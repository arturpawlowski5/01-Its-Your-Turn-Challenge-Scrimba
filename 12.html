				<h1><strong>12.</strong><br />Leverage <strong>Social Media</strong></h1>

				<p class="quote">Social media not only snatches your time, but also teaches you about attention deficiency. <br />~Neeraj Agnihotri</p>

				<p>Admit it or not, there is one common thing all of us can consider as our guilty pleasure - <strong>Social media.</strong></p>

				<p>What is the first thing you do after waking up in the morning?</p>

				<p>
					Even before you know it, you would find yourself turning your data on and logging on to one of those apps- Facebook & Instagram being two of the most widely
					used worldwide.
				</p>

				<p>By the same token, your last activity for the night also involves you looking up various posts and updates on social media.</p>

				<p>Be it interaction with friends, commenting, or reading news and articles, social media can be highly addictive and time-consuming, if not handled with care.</p>

				<p>It is regarded as one of the top-level distractions from work.</p>

				<p>
					Telecommuting is already accompanied by lots of distractions and you do not need further addition. Overall, if we see proper stats, we would observe that people
					spend more time on social media than on any other activity.
				</p>

				<p>In between work, if you cannot help but check your cell phone every time a new notification pops up, a moment of interruption appears.</p>

				<p>What can you possibly do to prevent this!!?</p>

				<p>You either bring self-restraint, which is not easily attained or detect an alternative means to achieve this.</p>

				<p>
					To get rid of such distractions, many new mobile apps have been introduced in recent times. These applications reveal to users the quantity of time they spend
					on each social media app.
				</p>

				<p>
					Furthermore, some apps also help you set a fixed duration for each of the socializing apps and once your limited time usage is over, you are locked out from
					that app for the next 24hours.
				</p>

				<p>
					So you decide to assign 30 minutes to Instagram. Whilst you are using that app for less than the mentioned time, you are cool. The moment it is 30m:01s,
					Instagram automatically shuts you out until the next day.
				</p>

				<p>If you exhaust your time-limit at night itself, those apps would be disabled for you to use them in the daytime. Hence, It is the most feasible solution.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Install the time-revealing & time-setting apps</li>
					<li>Observe how much time you spend on each social media app</li>
					<li>Decide on a specific amount of time you want to dedicate to each app, in a day</li>
					<li>Develop some self-control and log into those apps only during breaks or post-work schedules</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In short, social media can be rendered as a boon and a curse.</p>
