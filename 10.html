				<h1><strong>10.</strong><br />Take a Stroll <strong>During Lunch Break</strong></h1>

				<p>When you are working full time from home, it can be really exasperating for your mind to keep your attention in one place.</p>

				<p>In office, you get tea breaks, lunch breaks and your colleagues to have small talks with. But the <strong>home office</strong> life is totally different.</p>

				<p>
					You work alone and try to <strong>focus on your goals</strong> for the day and there is no certain planned break. If you are a workaholic and your workload is
					high, you tend to put all your efforts into the work.
				</p>

				<p>
					Doing so, you may, at times, skip lunch and short breaks. Faced with such a situation, instead of missing out on meals, you ought to get some air and calm down.
				</p>

				<p>
					On any other normal day, the best suggestion would be to go out or take your pet for a walk. However, amidst the coronavirus pandemic, that would not be very
					wise.
				</p>

				<p>What you can do, in place of that, is take a stroll in the lawn, home campus or your terrace.</p>

				<p>
					You are free to go outside, provided you take the required safety measures, maintain social distancing and avoid crowds. All you need is your body to move, in
					order to prevent inactiveness.
				</p>

				<p>A fresh mind can help you become active and productive.</p>

				<p>Lunch breaks can come in handy when you have no purpose to go out. You can put those one-hour long breaks to some use by running some errands for the house.</p>

				<p>Ask your mother if she needs groceries or look around and check for yourself if you are short of something.</p>

				<p>
					For a doctorâ€™s appointment or any other casual meet too, always make use of those lunch breaks. That way you get a good reason to head out without hampering
					your work.
				</p>

				<p>
					The natural light and fresh air outside are refreshing- something we all call for, amid a hectic work schedule. Besides, your family members would also want you
					to take a break and not be grumpy and stress out.
				</p>

				<p>To-do:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Walk away from your workspace</li>
					<li>Put on some casual wear</li>
					<li>Grab the essentials (mask, sanitizer, gloves, etc.)</li>
					<li>Head out</li>
				</ul>

				<p>It is as simple as it sounds.</p>
